    <h1>At the Zoo</h1>
    <p>First I saw the white bear, then I saw the black; <br>
Then I saw the camel with a hump upon his back; <br>
Then I saw the grey wolf, with mutton in his maw; <br>
Then I saw the wombat waddle in the straw; <br>
Then I saw the elephant a-waving of his trunk; <br>
Then I saw the monkeys â€“ mercy, how unpleasantly they smelt!</p>
